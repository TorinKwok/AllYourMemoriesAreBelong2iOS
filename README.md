### What's this?

Question:

> I'd like to test my app functions well in low memory conditions, but it's difficult to test. How can I induce low memory warnings that trigger the `didReceiveMemoryWarning` method in my ViewControllers when the app is running on the real device, not the simulator? Or what are some ways I can test my app under these possible conditions?

> The reason I can't use the simulator is my app uses Game Center and invites don't work on the simulator.

Okay, this tool simulates iOS on-device memory warnings like a hero.
